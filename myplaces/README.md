# myplaces
MyPlaces is a Flutter mobile application designed to retrieve and display a list of interesting places in Malaysia from a RESTful API. It uses the http package to fetch data, which is then parsed into a type-safe Place model. The app features a responsive list view and provides detailed information via a dialog upon tap. Critical to its design are robust state handling (Loading, No Data, Network Errors) and graceful image error handling.
