I confirm that this project represents my own original work in accordance with academic integrity policies. No part of the code was fully generated by AI tools such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot. I relied solely on lecture notes, class tutorials, and official Flutter documentation. I understand that my work may be scrutinized, and if it is found that I did not personally develop the code, marks may be deducted, or the submission may be disqualified
